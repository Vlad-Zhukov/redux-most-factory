# redux-most-factory Â· [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/redux-most-factory.svg)](https://npm.im/redux-most-factory)

I am tired of managing actions, actions creators and reducers in Redux.
Luckily, I am not alone, so there are many cool libraries simplifying
that. I am also tired of managing actions, actions creators and epics
in [`redux-most`](https://github.com/joshburgess/redux-most).
Well, I hope I am alone on this one too, but there are no such libraries
yet, so here is it. These 10 lines of code cut half of my files with
epics, and make me much happier.

## Install

```bash
yarn add redux-most-factory
  # or
npm install --save redux-most-factory
```

## Usage

Instead of doing this:

```js
import {map} from 'most';
import {select, combineEpics} from 'redux-most';

/* Actions */

const INCREMENT = '@epic/INCREMENT';
const DECREMENT = '@epic/DECREMENT';

/* Epics */

const incrementEpic = (action$) => {
    const increment$ = select(INCREMENT, action$);
    return map(() => ({type: 'INCREMENT'}), increment$);
}

const decrementEpic = (action$) => {
    const decrement$ = select(DECREMENT, action$);
    return map(() => ({type: 'DECREMENT'}), decrement$);
}

/* Action Creators */

export const increment = () => ({
    type: INCREMENT,
});

export const decrement = () => ({
    type: DECREMENT,
});

export default combineEpics([incrementEpic, decrementEpic]);
```

You can do this:

```js
import {map} from 'most';
import epicFactory from 'redux-most-factory';

const epics = {
    increment: action$ => map(() => ({type: 'INCREMENT'}), action$),
    decrement: action$ => map(() => ({type: 'DECREMENT'}), action$),
};

export default epicFactory(epics, '@epic/');
/*
 * {
 *     epic, // the result of combineEpics
 *     increment,
 *     decrement,
 * }
 */
```

## API

### epicFactory(epics, prefix)

__Arguments__

1. `epics` _(Object)_: An object of functions. Each property key will
be used as both an action prefixed with a `prefix`, and a name of an
action creator function. Action creator can take a single argument
&ndash; `payload` &ndash; and returns an object that can be dispatched.
2. `prefix` _(String)_: It will be used to prefix all actions of these
`epics`.
